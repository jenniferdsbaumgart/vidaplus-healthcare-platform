### Modern healthcare management platform

VidaPlus is my capstone project, developed by myself. It's a hospital and healthcare service management system focussed on accessibility, usability, and intuitive dashboards. It supports role-based access (patient, doctor, admin). I handled the front-end and am currently working on the back-end with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma.

## Features

- Patient registration and appointment scheduling.
- Appointment scheduling, cancellation, and notifications
- Secure login for doctors, admins, and patients.
- Healthcare professional management (schedules, prescriptions, records)
- Dashboard with service history and charts.
- Telemedicine with secure video consultations

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Next.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL

**Others**: JWT, bcrypt
